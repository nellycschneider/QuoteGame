# Quote Game

As part of the Ironhack full time web development bootcamp I am attending at the moment we had to create a game as our first project. 

I decided to make a quiz game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

The first thing I did was design a "homepage" with a button/link that will take you to the second HTML file, where you can play the actual game.
